# Interactions

This is a maven project. I have used Karate DSL to automated the APIs.

Highlights of the Framework

Karate DSL is a very easy language which is understood by anyone without having much technical knowledge.
Cucumber reporting which depicts clear understandin of the API results.
Feature file is where all the tests are written. Each scenario depicts one test
Karate config.js file is where all the global values are stored.
Tests Can be run as follows:

Right click on the feature file and run. Under - interactionsapitest\src\test\java\interactions\api\weather.feature
Run the APITest class. (Preffered) Under - interactionsapitest\src\test\java\interactions\APITest.java
Report can be found under: interactionsapitest\target\cucumber-html-reports\overview-features.html - right click and open this in a broswer of your choice
Output csv file can be found under : interactionsapitest\target\examples\users\readto.csv
